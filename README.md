Another online judge, another repository 

Same deal as the Codeforces repository but I'll try to keep all scripts in C++ here

I'm still fairly new (and as a result, bad) to competitive programming so most of the problems that I am able to solve are fairly trivial but as Jake the Dog points out, "Sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something."
